Section c: Early achievements track-record (max 2 pages)
 List your activities as stated in the Information for Applicants p. 24.
 Don’t forget to list 5 representative publications and highlight those without the presence of your
PhD supervisor (minimum 1).
 Choose the achievements that are highly valuated in YOUR domain. It depends a lot on the domain
if it’s rather first authorship, last authorship, conference proceedings etc.
 The publications are the part the evaluators seem to be most interested in.
 No repetition from the CV necessary. Don’t give the same information twice.
 You can comment on your publications. E.g., if you are from a domain where peer reviewing is not
widely used, you can briefly explain this. This can be helpful for cross-disciplinary researchers who
will be assessed by evaluators from two completely different scientific domains.
