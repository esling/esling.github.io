Innovative pedagogy actions

Music machine learning

The new trends in computing place an increasing emphasis on machine learning (ML) techniques. However, these aspects were not taught inside the ATIAM Master prior to my arrival. I decided to develop a teaching centered on various ML algorithms, applied to musical information. I created both the lesson plan and materials. I also developed an extensive tutorial, which can be seen as a series of missing code exercices targeted at understanding the fundamental notion and equations in each technique. Slides and tutorial available at http://repmus.ircam.fr/esling/atiam-ml.html.

Concurrent and reactive programming

This unit that has been recently created in the STL Master at UPMC, was mainly coordinated and created by Carlos Agon, but I took an active part in the creation of all aspects and projects related to reactive programming. Hence, thanks to a collaboration set up with ESTEREL Technologies, we obtained academic licences for the students, so that they can learn a widespread language used by multiple avionics, electricity and transport companies. I also bought several drones, so that this year the project will be to program an autonomous drone to perform a topographic map of a room. Project and details are available at https://www-master.ufr-info-p6.jussieu.fr/2015/PPC.

Java L2 - Mobile platforms object-oriented development

This unit is given as part of an industrial training bachelor at UPMC. I took the main coordination and organization of this unit, by recreating the whole schedule and corresponding materials. As students chose this formation in order to find a job in the industry, I focused my teaching on applications that are currently well-seeked . Therefore, even though theoretical aspects are given, all applications are targeted at both Web development and mobile (Android and iOS) platforms. Current slides and description are available at http://repmus.ircam.fr/esling/java.html.

Other teaching units

In multiple teaching units, notably MPIL (LI332) and PC2R (MI019), I proposed to devise innovative projects for applying the newly acquired coding skills of students to projects with musical applications. I believe that projects with an increased interest to its endeavor will drive students to work out of passion rather than obligation.


Jury participations


Originality of research and major results

Automatic computational orchestration

Since taking position at IRCAM on September 2013, I am responsible for directing and coordinating the research axis on musical orchestration. In this context, I worked towards the development of innovative algorithms and interfaces for computer-aided orchestration, by developing new heuristic approaches for approximating orchestral targets and complex temporal articulations. This work led to the first computer-aided orchestration software called Orchids in November 2014. This software is the first to provide a way to recreate any sound with a musical orchestra, and is sold through the IRCAM Forum, with a worldwide community of several thousands of users.

Creative artificial intelligence

Since 2014, I have been working . By using ideas derived from deep neural network learning, the goal is to provide new ways to understand the creative processes underlying musical orchestration. Together with a PhD student, we developped the first prototype of a software able to produce a musical orchestration from a simple piano input, in real-time. 

Multiobjective time series matching

I pursued theoretical researches on time series (ACM Computing Surveys, 2012) that subsequently raised a question yet to be challenged in the scientific literature. I introduced the idea to assess the similarity of multiple decorrelated temporal evolutions through a flexible multiobjective framework, called Multi-Objective Time Series (MOTS) matching. The idea of this paradigm is to take into account the multidimensional aspects of all elements studied based on multiple temporal structures. Thus, the similarity of different temporal forms is studied jointly without mixing the different measures of distance, addressing any research problem centered on temporal analysis by providing multidimensional similarities for temporal forms. These paradigms of innovative data mining have been extended to classification problems and also achieved excellent results in bio-monitoring, cardiology, robotic, climatology.

Environmental monitoring through DNA

The analysis of bio-diversity through Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) to monitor the environmental state through DNA communities in the deep sea. However, the characteristics of NGS datasets produce hundreds of millions of DNA sequences. I developed analysis algorithms to include the temporal evolution of biological diversity through treatment of massive sequencing of several billion ancient DNA sequences. My work resulted in the publication of numerous studies in journals with high impact factor, but also the advent of two first-of-kind computer software for parameter-free clustering used by several teams of molecular biologists. The development of these software continues to this day due to the interest of the scientific community for them.

International mobility help

Regarding international mobility, I try to engage as much as possible so that my PhD student can all perform at least a part of their research in an international laboratory. My first PhD (Pierre Talbot) is currently performing an invited research at the National Institute of Informatics (NII) in Tokyo, Japan, thanks to an international funding that we set up. I am also actively setting up a collaboration with McGill University to facilitate the student exchange program with IRCAM.

Professionnal insertion

I am an active teacher for the professional insertion course given at IRCAM for the ATIAM Masters. In that framework, I am giving two main courses

• Scientific publication (3 hours) is a lesson given in english in order to provide students with the basis of both scientific publication and different aspects of research workflows.

• Scientific carreer (3 hours) is a lesson centered on the different aspects of a carreer in academia. Students are sensitized to different ways to apply for a PhD and what is implied along a scientific career.
