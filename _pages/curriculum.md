Section c: Early achievements track-record (max 2 pages)
 List your activities as stated in the Information for Applicants p. 24.
 Don’t forget to list 5 representative publications and highlight those without the presence of your
PhD supervisor (minimum 1).
 Choose the achievements that are highly valuated in YOUR domain. It depends a lot on the domain
if it’s rather first authorship, last authorship, conference proceedings etc.
 The publications are the part the evaluators seem to be most interested in.
 No repetition from the CV necessary. Don’t give the same information twice.
 You can comment on your publications. E.g., if you are from a domain where peer reviewing is not
widely used, you can briefly explain this. This can be helpful for cross-disciplinary researchers who
will be assessed by evaluators from two completely different scientific domains. 

Scientific excellence is the sole criterion, subject of evaluation is the pair (principal investigator).

Competitive candidate must have shown potential for research independence and evidence of maturity.  
At least one important publication without the participation of their PhD supervisor.

3. Granted patent(s) (if applicable);  
4. Invited presentations to peer-reviewed conferences and/or international advanced schools (if applicable);
