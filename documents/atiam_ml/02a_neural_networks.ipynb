    "When building neural networks we frequently think of arranging the computation into layers, some of which have learnable parameters which will be optimized during learning. In `PyTorch`, the `nn` package provides higher-level abstractions over raw computational graphs that are useful for building neural networks. The `nn` package defines a set of `Modules`, which are roughly equivalent to neural network layers. A `Module` receives input `Tensors` and computes output `Tensors`, but may also hold internal state such as `Tensors` containing learnable parameters. The nn package also defines a set of useful loss functions that are commonly used when training neural networks.\n",
